JS Postman Tests
This repository contains REST API tests in JS used in the Postman client. A few notes:

    Variables such as {URL}, {USER}, {PASS} need to be defined before use.
    Assertions for status codes are tailored to the configuration of the specific API.
    Assertions related to file upload/download require the definition of file paths.
